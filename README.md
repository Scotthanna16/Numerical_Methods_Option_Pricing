# Numerical_Methods_Option_Pricing
This repository contains the data, code, and final paper for my undergraduate math project. It is a study on different numerical methods for option pricing. I start by going through the math behind option pricing, topics discussed include Wiener Processes, Stochastic Differential Equations, and the Black-Scholes Equation. Then I move on to discuss numerical methods including the Euler-Maruyama Method, Binomial Option Pricing Model, and Monte Carlo Simulation. Each of the methods is followed by an example. For EMM we simulate the price of the S&P500. Using the BOPM, I compare the price of premiums for European and American style call options on the S&P500. Finally, I use the Monte Carlo method to explain Asian style options.
